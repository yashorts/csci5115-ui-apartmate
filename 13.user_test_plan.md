 User Test Plan 
==============

Section - 2 Team - 8
====================

Objectives
==========

We have two objectives through this user test plan.

The first one is to determine how much faster is the search of
apartments and roommates using our app compared to a standard platform
like apartments.com. This is a summative objective.+

The second objective is to observe users interacting with our app
without any pre-determined knowledge of the app. The intention is to
assess the intuitiveness and ease of use of UI elements in our app. This
is exploratory and formative objective.

Users
=====

Our users shall be primarily students of the University of Minnesota.

Tasks, Methods, and Metrics
===========================

For the first objective, our metric is time.

1.  We first ask the users to **search** for one best apartment in
    > Minneapolis and one best matching roommate in a particular area of
    > interest in standard platforms like apartments.com (app) and
    > roommmates.com (website on mobile). They should try to do so as if
    > they are in a hurry.

2.  We measure the **time** they take for this activity.

3.  We ask them to **repeat the same with our app** by giving them
    > **detailed walkthroughs** and measure the time.

4.  The **difference b/w the times** shall represent the success of the
    > first objective.

As the second objective is more exploratory the metrics are reactions of
users to design elements and design decisions, trouble spots in
completing any task they want to and getting feedback about missing
features.

1.  First, an **audience with no prior knowledge** of the app is chosen.

2.  Then they are given the tasks of searching for an apartment, a
    > roommate and contributing to the apartment community without any
    > detailed walkthroughs.

3.  The feedback given by the userâ€™s reactions to design elements, the
    > detection of trouble spots and missing features mark the success
    > of this objective.
