<!-- -->

-   Felt amenities & things like a gym or pool were unimportant

-   How did you find your most recent apartment?

    -   Heard through word of mouth, from friends who lived there.
        > Pretty much the first apartment she heard of, ended up going
        > through with it

    -   Did additional research through Google Maps — looked online,
        > what’s in the area & close to campus. Also researched the
        > apartment online; feels the website should’ve showed the
        > inside of the building or variations of the floor plan.

    -   Also looked at Wahu because it was “a super colorful building,”
        > user had always taken note of it

    -   Tried to get it done “too early” — October 2018.

    -   First day they moved in was a surprise bc the actual place
        > looked pretty diff from model floorplan online.

    -   Doesn’t remember what reviews she looked at (i.e. Google Reviews
        > or apartments.com)

    -   Found it difficult to see all the options in one place; user had
        > to research each individually

-   User toured the facilities beforehand w/ her parents and other
    > roommates

**Roommates**

-   Was very easy for user to find roommates because they were her
    > friends from classes/dorm, but user does think “it would have been
    > nice to connect with other people that were looking for housing”

-   What expectations do you have for your roommates?

    -   Be clean, be nice. Prefers if they didn’t smoke; no juuling.
        > Doesn’t mind pets; doesn’t like cats though

-   What do you think about the roommate-finding services the U
    > currently offers?

    -   Inefficient — how are you supposed to get to know them?

    -   Doesn’t consider herself well informed on the U’s off campus
        > living resources

    -   If user didn’t already know their friends, messaging seems like
        > the most effective way to know potential roommates — knowing
        > more about their habits — knowing their preferences

-   What do you wish you knew before you started apartment/roommate
    > hunting?

    -   Wish she knew what time to start bc everyone’s all over the
        > place; freshman don’t know when to figure housing out and are
        > all told conflicting information.

        -   “Everyone told you to figure it out right away”

    -   User wishes she took more time to find housing, called their
        > process “hasty, but luckily it turned out fine”

    -   User wishes she had known more about lease signing, and regrets
        > that she didn’t know what floor plan she would get until move
        > in day

        -   Their apartment has no natural light; “kind of a crappy
            > view,” so user & her roommates “waste energy by turning
            > lights on”
