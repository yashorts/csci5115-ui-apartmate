Participant 5 (Jiajun)
----------------------

Subject demographic: College student, age 22

He was confused about the modification of the apartment. He thought if
anyone can modify the information of the apartment, the information may
be not true.

He is very familiar with apartments.com, and it took him 2:55 to find
his best apartment in Minneapolis. When he tried to use our app to find
the apartment he likes, it took him 3:13. And then, he used
roomster.com, he typed the name of the apartment he likes in the search
bar and found some people that he would like to live with which took him
4:03. When he did that in our app, it was a little different. He set the
filter rather than type in the name of the apartment. And that took him
3:14.

 

Participant 6 (Jiajun)
----------------------

Subject demographic: College student, age 22

He was confused about the filters in the user search part. If he set
“pets ok” option to be true, then all the people on the result page have
pets. But he just wanted to find someone who doesn’t mind if he keeps a
dog.

He is not familiar with any of these apps. It took him 3:43 when using
the apartments.com and 4:03 in our app. It took him 5:33 when using the
roomster.com and 4:45 in our app.
