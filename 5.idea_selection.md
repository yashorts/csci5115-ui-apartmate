**User Goals & Motivations (drawn from Qualitative Analysis)**

1.  Find potential apartments/roommates (few criteria)

2.  Determine that information about a posting is accurate

3.  Evaluate between potential apartments/roommates (many criteria)

4.  Communicate with potential lessors/current residents/roommates

OLD:

-   Search apts in a neat personalized fashion (amenities, surroundings,
    > transportation, distances, video tour)

-   View all listings at one place

-   Search for roommates and broadcast available roommate positions

-   Need a way to see if listing/review is trustworthy

-   Communicate with roommates and/ or lessors

**Implications (finalized)**

1.  Minimalistic, Informative and Customizable listings (search results)

2.  Make app popular & Let users create new listings

3.  Support user profiles and "roommate needed" polls

4.  Implement verification of apartment listings especially the ones
    > created by general users and let users give verified reviews

5.  Chat system b/w users and b/w user and leasor

6.  Misc

    1.  Description of surroundings is preferable

    2.  Support tour (video, 3d vr) of the apartment

    3.  Roommate and Apt services need to be independent
