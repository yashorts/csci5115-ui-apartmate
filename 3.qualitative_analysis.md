        > the one online & the one shown to them in tours; bit of a
        > disappointment.

    -   Ex. Subject 1 was in India when leasing the apartment, wanted to
        > experience the apartment through video

Summary

Difficulties are experienced when people search for new apartments
and/or roommates which match their expectations using currently
available services. People want to have information about apartments to
be more consolidated and accurate. Time is spent searching among
different services for listings, and often the reality of visiting a
place is different from the expectations from reading the provided
online information. Finding roommates outside of a social circle
basically doesn’t occur, people would rather enter a lease with unknown
new people than go through current available services to find
like-minded roommates. People we interviewed were frustrated with the
difference in expectations when living with unknown new people. Groups
of friends looking for an apartment is commonplace and their expectation
is finding a lease which supports the entire group. The expectations of
each person in such a group are understood to be close enough to be
satisfied living with one another.
