Heuristic Evaluation

1.  **Visibility of system status**:  
    > The system should always keep users informed about what is going
    > on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.

    1.  Assumed notification system whenever you receive a new message
        > (Ex. Bubble that says “10” when you have 10 new messages)

2.  **Match between system and the real world**:  
    > The system should speak the user's language, with words, phrases
    > and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented
    > terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in
    > a natural and logical order.

    1.  Very visual; easy to follow

    2.  Do we have a “home” screen (i.e. when you first open)? Difficult
        > to navigate back to that page

    3.  “Broadcast” is a confusing term

    4.  “Customize apartment cards” is confusing — maybe this option
        > should be placed amongst filters in search?

3.  **User control and freedom**:  
    > Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a
    > clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state
    > without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo
    > and redo.

    1.  Lots of customization options, can add and remove items from
        > filters/etc

    2.  Very straightforward & lacks need for “emergency exit”

    3.  Maybe there should be an option so user can “favorite” listings

4.  **Consistency and standards**:  
    > Users should not have to wonder whether different words,
    > situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform
    > conventions.

    1.  Currently no relationship between the name “Quick Info” and the
        > expansion of a short apartment entry

5.  **Error prevention**:  
    > Even better than good error messages is a careful design which
    > prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either
    > eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present
    > users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.

    1.  Showing verified badges for safety

    2.  Not showing “unverified” in cases where user or listing is not
        > verified

6.  **Recognition rather than recall**:  
    > Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and
    > options visible. The user should not have to remember information
    > from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of
    > the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever
    > appropriate.

    1.  On main search page, displaying both the map and list views at
        > the same time help the user visualize the location of each
        > apartment on the list

7.  **Flexibility and efficiency of use**:  
    > Accelerators—unseen by the novice user—may often speed up the
    > interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to
    > both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor
    > frequent actions.

    1.  The tab bar lets you efficiently move between main features,
        > while keeping the side bar as a tab bar object allows the user
        > to access more specific features easily

8.  **Aesthetic and [minimalist
    > design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disclosure)**:  
    > Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or
    > rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue
    > competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes
    > their relative visibility.

    1.  Overall app is pretty minimal, no screens have excessive text

    2.  Hamburger menu is in danger of becoming a long list of unrelated
        > things

9.  **Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**:  
    > Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes),
    > precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a
    > solution.

    1.  We don’t have any error messages currently in the app

10. **Help and documentation**:  
    > Even though it is better if the system can be used without
    > documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and
    > documentation. Any such information should be easy to search,
    > focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out,
    > and not be too large.

    1.  We don’t have any help/documentation currently in the app

        1.  Maybe include this in hamburger menu?
